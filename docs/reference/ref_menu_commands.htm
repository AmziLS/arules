  <!amzi_index=New Rule Set; Trace Query; Export Rule Set; Support Forum; Tutorial; Documentation; Samples; About>
  These functions can be triggered by from menu items and/or the control 
  panel:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>New Rule Set...</b> - Prompts for the name of a new rule set and creates it 
    in the currently selected cells by default. You can click on the range icon to indicate a different cell range. The new rule set will contain 
    the name of the rule set in the first cell. You can rename a rule set by changing that name. You can make a rule set larger or smaller by inserting or deleting cells into/from the rule set box. The rule set name becomes an Excel name corresponding to the cell range 
    of the rule set. </p>
  <p><b>Remove Rule Set...</b> - Removes the currently selected rule set. This turns all the rules into plain text. You can turn the text back into a rule set by selecting the cells and using <b>New Rule Set...</b>. </p>
  <p><b>Load Modified Rules</b> - Loads modified rule sets so they can be used 
    in RQuery()s again. Once a rule set is modified, RQuery()s display an error 
    message until the rules are loaded again. Also available on the right mouse 
    button.</p>
  <p><b>Reload All Rules</b> - Reloads all rule sets whether modified or not. 
    Typically this isn't necessary but sometimes a fresh start is nice.</p>
  <p><b>Trace Query </b> - Starts the trace facility for the rule query in the currently 
    selected cell. You can step through the execution of the rules and see 
    which rules were used in the answering of the query.</p>
  <p><b>Open Trace Log File </b>- Opens the trace log file from the last trace run. Unlike the trace display, this log contains all the actions the rule engine made to answer the query.</p>
  <p><b>Export Rule Sets... </b> - Prompts for the name of the file that contains 
    all the rule sets in the open workbook. This file can be opened and queried 
    from a variety of web-based and stand-alone applications using the <a href="../api/index.htm">ARulesXL 
    API</a>. (Professional Edition only) </p>
  <p><b>Export Rule Sets into Workbook</b> - Export the binary form of the rules 
    into the spreadsheet itself. This allows the spread sheet to be distributed 
    with working, but un-modifiable rules. (Professional Edition only) </p>
  <p><b>Convert for Sharepoint</b> - Sharepoint requires slight modifications 
    in UDFs, so this utility converts those functions for publication on a sharepoint 
    server. (Professional Edition only) </p>
  <p><b>Convert Back to Excel</b> - Takes a Sharepoint formated ARulesXL workbook 
    and converts it back to normal Excel for further maintenance and developement 
    of rules. (Professional Edition only) </p>
  <p><b></b><b>Tutorial</b> - Opens the tutorials in this documentation. </p>
  <p><b></b><b>Documentation</b> - Opens the HTML documentation. Can also be opened 
  from the ARulesXL menu on the Windows Start Menu. </p>
  <p><b>Samples</b> - Let's you open one of the ARulesXL sample spreadsheets.</p>
  <p><b>Support Forum </b> - Opens the ARulesXL technical support forum on the ARulesXL web site.</p>
  <p><b>About</b> - The about box for ARulesXL, including license information. </p>
</blockquote>
