<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Quick Tour of the ARulesXL Excel 
  Environment</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An ARulesXL rule set is a collection 
  of facts, decision tables, rules, formulas and logical relations that are used 
  to determine the output fact values based on input fact values.</font></p>
<p><img src="inputs_rules_output.gif" width="484" height="304"></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Simple Example</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For example,consider these rules 
  used to determine the price of a phone call based on whether the call was made 
  on a weekend or weekday and during the day or night:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A weekend call costs 4 cents.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A weekday call during the day 
    costs 8 cents.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A weekday call at night costs 
    6 cents.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output is the value of the fact 
  <var>rate</var>, and the inputs are the values of the facts <var>weekend</var> 
  and <var>daytime</var>. Here are the rules in an ARulesXL rule set:</font></p>
<p><img src="price_rules_00.gif" width="641" height="199"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rule set is queried very much 
  like a database using the function RQuery(). In the function window above you 
  can see the query that asks to find the value of <var>rate</var>. It also sets 
  the input facts, <var>weekend</var> and <var>daytime</var> to the values in 
  cells C4 and C5. RQuery() returns the value of <var>rate</var> derived from 
  the rules in the rule set named RateRules.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ARulesXL also supports decision tables. 
  The same application could have been expressed using a decision table:</font></p>
<p><img src="price_rules_0.gif" width="678" height="238"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The choice of which to use really 
  just depends on which seems to fit the specifications more naturally.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A More Complex Example</font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to input and output properties, 
  a rule set can have intermediate facts that are used to determine the value 
  of output properties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Suppose we wanted the inputs to be:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> the day of the week,</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the time of day and</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the duration of the call.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> And we wanted the rule set to determine 
  the price of the call. Also, the rate is not fixed, but a multiple of a single 
  base rate. The new specifications are:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Price is duration * rate</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A weekend is Saturday, Sunday, 
    and Friday after 8:00PM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daytime is between the hours of 
    8:00AM and 6:00PM.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The rates of calls are based on 
    a single base rate, which is 4 cents.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output fact will now be <var>price</var>. 
  The output fact is also called a goal of the rule set.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A combination of decision tables, 
  rules, and fact values are used in the rule set to determine the value of <var>price</var>. 
  Note that decision tables and rules can be used together to determine fact values. 
  <var>Weekend</var> is determined with a simple decision case for the easy days, 
  but rules are used for the exception case of Friday, which can be either a weekend 
  or not depending on the time.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How it works</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The decision tables, rules, facts 
  and formulas are entered in any order in the rule set, much as data is entered 
  in a database. A rule engine is used to determine the output property value 
  from the inputs. It will dynamically choose the rules and table entries necessary 
  for producing the answer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The output property becomes a goal 
  of the rule engine. If that property depends on other properties, those properties 
  become sub-goals of the rule engine. Each of those might require further sub-goals 
  until the input properties are reached. Here are the sub-goals used in the example 
  query.</font></p>
<p><img src="sub_goals.gif" width="662" height="266"></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Internally, the rules are stored 
  in an optimized format allowing for fast query execution based on differing 
  inputs. Because the goal tree is dynamically generated, the developer does NOT 
  have to worry about flow of control. The rules are simply written as specified.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is why it is easy to develop, 
  maintain and audit this type of application using a rule engine like ARulesXL.</font></p>
