This is the source code for ARulesXL. The system has two major components.

Prolog - the rule language and reasoning engine used in ARulesXL are written in Prolog, using DCG for the language.  Note that it would be relatively easy to create a new language with the same integration points as the existing one.

Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) - The glue that connects the rule engine and language to spreadsheet cells is written using VBA.  The application is called ARulesXL.xla.

ARulesXL is a perfect example of the sorts of things that can be built using Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server.  The Amzi! Prolog portion is used as a meta-language for creating a new rule language and reasoning engine.  The Logic Server is used to allow easy integration with VBA and thus an Excel spreadsheet.
