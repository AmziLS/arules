<h1>Audit Tools</h1>
<p>ARulesXL is an excellent tool for implementing audit applications, as required, 
  for example, by Sarbanes Oxley.</p>
<p>An audit application is composed of financial form templates and associated 
  audit rules. Company data is mapped into the templates, the audit rules are 
  applied and the analysis is output.</p>
<p><img src="images/audit_architecture.gif" width="512" height="260"></p>
<p>Because the rules are declarative, they are easy to write, easy to read and 
  easy to verify as correct.</p>
<h2>Simple Example</h2>
<p>The following screen shots show a simple example using basic balance sheets 
  and income statements for two successive periods.</p>
<p>The green cells are intended to contain values from actual company financial 
  statements. The rules are on a separate worksheet described later.</p>
<p><img src="images/audit_financial_form.gif" width="465" height="362"></p>
<p>The light blue cells contain the output analysis. In this case the balance 
  statement for the current period is incorrect, as is the capital for that report.</p>
<p>The output is just a simple description in the example. Full text reports could 
  be generated instead, or the cells of the financial templates could be flagged 
  with Excel comments.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the function window, the output is generated by an RQuery() 
  call to the rule engine, asking for the value of the fact <var>Problems</var>.</p>
<p>The rules are entered in an ARulesXL rule set.</p>
<p><img src="images/simple_audit_rules.gif" width="631" height="413"></p>
<p>The first four lines, starting with <var>RArray:</var> are function calls that 
  read the financial templates into the rule engine.</p>
<p>The different types of problem are represented as elements in an array of problems, 
  where the index into the array is a small description of the problem itself. 
  Each rule states the conditions under which that problem applies.</p>
<p>The last rule makes a list of all of the problems that apply.</p>
<p>The rules can be as complex as desired, and can refer to other rules for analyzing 
  complex relationships between different areas of the financial statements.</p>
<p>The rule sets can be modularized, so there are different rule sets performing 
  different parts of the audit.</p>
